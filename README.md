# 📚 My Life Library

## 🌐 Live Demo
Check out the live demo of the project [here](https://ritagr.github.io/MyLifeLibrary/).

## 📖 Introduction
I've always been a big reader and lover of books. As part of reading and collecting books, you also develop a need to track all the books you've read. This - I've decided - can be done in a fun and modern way, using code!

## 💡 Initial Idea
The initial idea for this project was to create falling books into a "pile" enabling you to visually see on the screen all the books and titles you've read. I also wanted to add the ability to move the books around as an interactive way for the user to engage.

## 🛠️ Technologies
At first, I stumbled on this [Code Pen Project](https://codepen.io/liabru/pen/jwXqOd) and that's how I discovered [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/docs/). This is what I was going for: [Air Friction](https://brm.io/matter-js/demo/#airFriction). This project is inspired by the [Beit Ariela Library Website](https://ariela.today/). Dot menu used material from [Codrops](https://github.com/codrops/DotNavigationStyles).

## 🌟 Features
- 📚 Visual representation of books you've read.
- 🖱️ Interactive books that can be moved around.
- 📅 Dot navigation to switch between years, displaying different book collections.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the project locally.
