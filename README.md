# :books: My Life Library

## Introduction
I've always been a big reader and lover of books. As a part of reading and collecting books, you also develop a need to track all the books you've read.
This - I've decided - can be done in a fun and modern way, using code!

## Initial Idea
The initial idea for this project was to create falling books into a "pile" enabling you visually see on the screen all the books and titles you've read.
I also wanted to add the ability to move the books around as an interactive way for the user to engage.

## Technologies
At first i stumbled on this [Code Pen Project](https://codepen.io/liabru/pen/jwXqOd) and that's how I discovered [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/docs/)
This is what I was going for : [Air Friction](https://brm.io/matter-js/demo/#airFriction)
This project is inspired by [Beit Ariela Library Website](https://ariela.today/)
